With the release of all those lovely new scrolls in Echoes, and the imminence of Minecon, we thought we should create a bit of a party atmosphere.

So, every match played from 15:30 CET on Thursday 2nd of July till 9.00 CET on Monday July 6th will award twice the usual gold, giving players a chance to claim a spot on the leaderboard, and get rich in the process! As usual, Judgement rewards will not be boosted; sorry about that.


Wait a minute, Thursday 2nd? That’s now!


Enjoy.
