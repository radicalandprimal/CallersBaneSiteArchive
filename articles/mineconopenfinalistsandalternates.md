Congratulations to the last four MINECON Open finalists!

* \_antirad\_
* Dialex
* Nrp123
* Magpieman

Read on for more about the MINECON Open and an explanation of the alternate system.

## Previous finalists
* ChiefBromden
* Holofoil
* Tajic
* Jubape

## Bracket seeding
Remember, bracket seeding will be determined through Ranked rating recorded at 2200 GMT the day before the tournament (July 3rd).

The following playersâ€™ rating will also be recorded as a list of alternates should a finalist not be able to attend:

## Alternates
* Francony
* AllToDust
* alvarpq
* ktrey
* Tak4n
* NinjaTurtle
* lbrande

This means that the alternate with the highest rating shall have first chance to replace a player. Should there be a tie in rating, those players shall play one game to determine the finalist. Three way ties and higher will require a mini-bracket seeded by rating.

 

See you in London!
