# More on Judgement weight changes
We recognize the power of a few of the remaining unweighted treaties and made them a little harder to get. Consolidator Niara also saw a similar change.

On the other hand, we’d like to increase the availability of certain “comeback” scrolls. This means you should be able to include more of these in your deck if you’d like, and expect that your opponent may likely have them as well.

The following are the exact weights that have been applied:

* Consolidator Niara 25%
* Gloomstone Treaty 25%
* Border Treaty 25%
* Thundersurge 200%
* Blind Rage 200%
* Quake 200%
* Frost Gale 200%
* Inferno Blast 150%

# Accessing the Test Server
Everyone has access to the test server. You can access the Test Server by starting the Scrolls launcher, clicking “More Options”-> “Play Test Server”.

Have fun!
